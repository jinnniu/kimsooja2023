Workdescription:

To Breathe – Zone of Nowhere is a large-scale, site-specific installation of 30 colorful polyester flags, conceived by the artist especially for the void of PICA’s Central Galleries. The colors and symbols of multiple national flags are intermixed as a visual and symbolic breakdown of hierarchies, transcendence of boundaries, and blurring of the distinctions between different countries.

This work expresses a wish for coexistence,for a utopian society in which individuals can unite in celebration of our distinctions and common humanity. It originates from the video To Breathe - The Flags (2012), commissioned by the International Olympic Committee on the occasion of the London 2012 Summer Olympics, which depicts the world’s national flags dissolving in a continuous loop; their iconic surfaces morphing into one another. They appear in alphabetical order by country, without hierarchy or political prejudice, in the hope of creating a visual experience whereby national difference and conflicts can be merged and harmonised.
