Workdescription: The Wanås Foundation presents Sowing Into Painting a multidimensional project including site-specific installations, film, sculpture, and painting. Wana?s Konst is a unique cultural foundation in Southern Sweden, composed of a sculpture park and art galleries on the site of a medieval castle and an organic farm. Kimsooja’s exhibition incorporates the diversity of the location in newly-conceived works investigating the conceptual relationship between painting, agriculture and textiles.
