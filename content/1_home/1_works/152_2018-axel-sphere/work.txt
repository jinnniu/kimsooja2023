Workdescription: Gazing into Sphere is a site-specific installation that recontextualizes the architecture of a former gin distillery and invites visitors to a new spatial experience. Spanning the entire ground surfaceof the gallery space, installed mirrors and the vertical folding mirror screen, Encounter – A Mirror Woman (2017), unfold and expand the interior void, rendering the architectural envelope as the work itself, within which the audience is embraced. The sound piece, Unfolding Sphere (2016), reorients the audience’s sense of space by giving directional audio cues– the sound of clay balls rolling across a surface, a horizontal trajectory, followed by that of the artist gargling water, a vertical trajectory. In aural form, the work articulates a psychological geometry orbiting around these two axes.
