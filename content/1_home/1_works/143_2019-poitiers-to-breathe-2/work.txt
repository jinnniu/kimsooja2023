Workdescription: For more than two decades, the concept of bottari has developed in Kimsooja’s work, from her installations to her videos. Traditionally used to transport personal belongings, the bottari extends to spaces, sites, and architectures in her work. With To Breathe, her interest in painting and sewing come to the fore as the cloister windows of the Chapelle des Augustins are covered with film that diffracts light, functioning as a permeable canvas. Through the windows, the viewer’s moving gaze becomes a needle that weaves the piece together. The translucent film acts like a skin that envelops the windows and architecture of the cloister, defining the division between nature and the interior space. As rays of light pass through the glass, they multiply into an infinite number of colors that inhabit the space, move, and transform as the sun makes its daily journey. Each unique experience is an invitation to contemplate, and to discover a sensitive and spiritual passage to the unknown garden of the Chapelle des Augustins cloister
