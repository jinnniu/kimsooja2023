Workdescription: Kimsooja’s oeuvre is associated with traditional South Korean bedcovers, which she has used in several installations. In the sculpture park, she has instead chosen to work with old-fashioned white sheets that in Sweden are traditionally embroidered with a monogram or decorated with lace—objects that are a part of creating a home and that display care and reflection. Harald Szeeman has described the sheets in Kimsooja’s oeuvre as a theater for birth and death, our ephemeral condition. Extending her Laundry Woman series, they are like a hanging field of paintings, in the beech wood forest, while they simultaneously provide connections to the mundane.
