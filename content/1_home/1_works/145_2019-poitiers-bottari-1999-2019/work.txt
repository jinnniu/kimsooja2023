Workdescription: Moving from one continent to another, from the United States to South Korea, Kimsooja makes a stop in Poitiers to inhabit a shipping container painted with bright and vibrant lines in the traditional Korean colors of the Obangsaek. A monumental bottari, filled with Kimsooja’s personal belongings accumulated in the artist’s East Village apartment in New York over twenty years, sits at the foot of Poitiers Cathedral. Facing the imposing cathedral, Bottari 1999-2019 seems as small as the cloth bundles it references. Its shimmering colors contrast with the mineral quality of this place of worship, representing the freedom of choosing ones country and the dimension of mobility, as indicated by the cardinal color spectrum. Though usually made of knotted fabric, this steel bottari becomes a metaphor for Kimsooja’s perpetual movements and constitutes in the artist’s words, a “separate body, an autonomous world that can contain everything, like a ship” that can be closed without revealing its contents.
