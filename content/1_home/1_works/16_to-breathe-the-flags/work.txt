Workdescription:

To Breathe –The Flags is a series of site specific print installations for the Perth International Arts Festival Visual Arts Tour 2017, Perth, Australia. The installation was developed in tandem with he artist’s first Australian solo exhibition Zone of Nowhere. The exhibition featured a new, awe-inspiring installation of 30 large translucent flags suspended above PICA’s central gallery space, drawing upon her previous artwork commission by the International Olympic Committee for the London 2012 Summer Olympics.

The exhibition extends beyond the walls of PICA, with the same colorful layered flags appearing on public facades throughout Northbridge and the Perth CBD. The flags, at such a monumental size, placed in the most central parts of Perth, produce an inescapable encounter despite their imaginary status.
