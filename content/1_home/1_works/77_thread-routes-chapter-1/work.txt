Workdescription:

'Thread Routes' is Kimsooja’s first 16mm film series, after having spent more than three decades contextualizing and conceptualizing textiles as a canvas that supports a structural investigation of human life, nature and the world.

While contemporary art has long considered textiles as craft, Kimsooja has consistently sought to connect the nature of textiles to the performative, the sculptural/architectural, the notion of tableau and questions of gender, aesthetics and culture.

These non-descriptive and non-narrative documentary films were conceived after being inspired in Bruges, Belgium in 2002, by traditional lace making, and its performative elements and architectural structure.

Divided into six chapters, Thread Routes takes place in six different cultural zones around the world. Kimsooja considers her approach as a 'visual poem' and a 'visual anthropology' in juxtaposing and presenting structural similarities in performative elements of textile culture with the structures in nature, architecture, agriculture and gender relationships in different cultures. Kimsooja demonstrates the hidden reality of the diverse forms of textile construction, and contextualizes the relationship between textile making and architecture practices along side the natural geographical forms. Similar and distinctive elements of visual phenomena are woven and merged together as equal visual and cultural vocabularies. They also illustrate the similarities and differences in this gender oriented activity in different performative weaving, spinning, and sewing cultures. By defining this link Kimsooja creates a dialogue that enriches the context of contemporary art and life.

Taking this pure visual experience as a statement on how the artist gazes at the world, this poetic visual archeology becomes a retrospective of her practice in the past that continues today. Kimsooja considers the ‘Thread Routes’ series as a parallel performance to the needlework she has done since the early 1980’s, and its evolution into the ‘A Needle Woman’ performance series since 1999. This series took places from around the world as an encyclopedia of a needle and a thread. While ‘A Needle Woman’ investigates the dimensions of the needle, Kimsooja contextualizes contemporary art through her multi-disciplinary practice through eyes of a needle and thread that weave humanity, nature and cosmology consistently and evolutionary throughout her about forty year career. ‘Thread Routes’ traces the formal and psychological threads encompassing the textile structures to that of the body and the world, and human desire to culture.
