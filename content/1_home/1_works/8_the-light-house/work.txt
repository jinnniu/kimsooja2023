Workdescription:

Boghossian Foundation, Villa Empain, Brussels, Belgium
October 22, 2020 - January 31, 2021
Curator: Louma Salam√©

The Boghossian Foundation explores manifestations of light in art and the sensations it causes. The exhibition The Light House invites the public to experience a succession of personal and collective experiences with light, mostly immersive, through the works of 21 major contemporary artists, spanning nearly 60 years of artistic production.

Apart from the neon works, each of the guest artists, from Japan, South Korea, Palestine, Morocco, the United States and Belgium, has produced pieces or installations specially designed for this exhibition. The Light House offers a circuit which revolves around five themes: celestial light, murky light, the experience of colour, in praise of shadow, neon lights and light bulbs.
