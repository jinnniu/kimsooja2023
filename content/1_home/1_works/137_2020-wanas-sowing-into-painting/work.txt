Workdescription:

The title for the exhibition, Sowing into Painting, is also the title of Kimsooja’s new planting project. With this new work, Kimsooja expands her perspective on the (agri)cultural, conceptual, and material significance of painting and textiles. Taking advantage of something unique to the site that most art museums cannot offer—the possibility of farming the land, she uses the agricultural planting field surrounding the Wanås Foundation to experiment and cultivate a field of flax plants, a gesture referencing her decades-long exploration into painting as a conceptual art form.

Kimsooja plants two different local varieties of flax that are used to generate linseed oil and linen. Growing flax pulls us back within art history to the flax fibers that were used to manufacture textiles including canvas and linseed oil that is the classic binding agent in artists’ oil paints. By planting a field of flax plants, she metaphorically encapsulates the entire cycle of material production and considers the interplay of impermanence and perpetuity, and of life and art. These plants, which are grown and harvested in a period of several months, will transform into paintings that could last for centuries. Sown at the end of April, the flax fields will grow and change over the course of the exhibition from green sprouts to stalks with sky-blue flowers and seeds. As well as being a physical source of painting materials, the field becomes a fluid tableau, covering the ground in a pattern akin to weaving the earth.

Sowing into Painting is an expansion of the artist’s long fascination with agriculture and painting, evident in her series of Deductive Object works made in the early 90s by wrapping traditional farming tools from Korea and the US in fragments of used clothing, as well as her 1988 painting Agriculture, in which sewn and painted sections allude to abstraction and agrarian land plots simultaneously, and the word 'Agriculture' is written on the surface.
